## INTRODUCTION

The core values of Input | Output and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, "IO" or "Company") include integrity, ethics, service, excellence, and teamwork. Our culture inspires trust, respect and fairness that extends to our offline and online behavior. To ensure our employees and Service Providers align with these values, this Communications Policy establishes guidelines for external communications, including but not limited to speaking engagements, public endorsements, etc. Beyond these guidelines, this Communications Policy ("Policy") serves as a means to protect the Company's reputation, intellectual property, and minimize the risk of potentially damaging communications. Please note that all IO employees and Service Providers must adhere to this Policy along with all other IO policies and guidelines.

In this Policy we refer to employees and Service Providers as one group and expect all people with affiliated status to comply with this Policy, which may be updated at any time by IO. With that in mind, this Policy outlines two key areas: operating in a personal capacity and operating within an official capacity as a representative of IO. Both sections should be read by all employees and Service Providers, so you understand the expectations set forth by IO.

Please read these guidelines carefully and let us know if you have any questions by contacting the Growth Team at [comms@iohk.io](mailto:comms@iohk.io) or Legal Team at [legal@iohk.io](mailto:legal@iohk.io)

## I. OPERATING WITHIN A PERSONAL CAPACITY

### A. Definition

IO defines 'operating within a personal capacity' as an employee or Service Provider that has not received written official notice from their line manager and the Growth Team indicating that you have permission to speak with the media, engagement with the public, or publish on any platform, whether digital or otherwise, on behalf of IO.

While this Policy is not all encompassing of every potential scenario, we have identified some of the most common situations and how to engage appropriately.

### B. IO Sponsored Events

You are attending an IO event; however, the Growth Team has not identified you as a spokesperson for IO. You are likely attending the event as a subject matter expert ("SME") for your product or service and should therefore only speak to your area of focus. This would mean that while you are permitted to engage with fellow attendees of the event, you should only reference IO talking points provided by the Events Team on any topics outside of your scope and should refer the attendee to the identified product representative for further discussion.

If at any time a member of the media approaches you and asks you for a comment, do not attempt to give them an answer or engage with them. Instead, you should always refer them to a member of the Growth Team, or kindly state that you are not able to comment on that but that they may reach out to [media@iohk.io](mailto:media@iohk.io).

### C. Third Party Sponsored Events

In the case of third-party hosted events (which includes community meet ups), while you are permitted to identify yourself and the organization you work for to general attendees, you may only speak on topics related to your scope of work and should not speak on other IO products or services without using the approved messaging from the Growth Team. Regardless if you're speaking at an event in a personal capacity, the Growth Team requires that you notify them prior to accepting the invitation. For more information on the Notification Process, please review Section V (A).

**It is paramount that when you are attending or speaking at a third-party event that you clearly state that the opinions expressed here today are your own and are not a reflection of the organization's.** Also, don't forget your non-disclosure obligations to IO regarding confidential and proprietary information.

Finally, in our digital world, nothing is ever really not connected back to your organization. As such, the Growth Team asks that you adhere to the Communications Code of Conduct (Section IV) and remember that anyone could be considered 'media' thanks to the 24-hour news cycle and the ability for videos and soundbites to go viral. With that, it is important to remember that you are never permitted to speak to the media about IO, its products and services, or general company initiatives, when attending an event in a personal capacity.

## II. OPERATING WITHIN AN OFFICIAL CAPACITY AS AN IO SPOKESPERSON

### A. Definition

'Operating within an official capacity as an IO spokesperson' is defined as IO personnel that have received written approval from their line manager and the Growth Team to engage with the media, the public, attend events, or publish on a specific platform——as an official IO spokesperson.

While this Policy is not all encompassing of every potential scenario, we have identified some of the most common situations and how to engage appropriately.

### B. IO Sponsored Events

You are attending an IO event and the Growth Team has identified you as an SME that is permitted to speak in an official capacity with media on either a range of topics or matters related to IO, or a more targeted list of topics and matters related to IO. In this scenario, you are expected to adhere to confidentiality and privacy policy/data protection obligations as well as all policies outlined here, including the Communications Code of Conduct (Section IV), while also sticking to the approved messaging packet the Growth Team provided you for the event. Regardless if you are an authorized spokesperson, you are still required to coordinate with the Growth and Legal Teams on speeches, presentations, talking points, interviews, etc. before communicating publicly. For more information on the approval process, please review Section V (B). Please note that sometimes certain employees will only be allowed to speak on one subject (e.g. Lace), which means you are not permitted to act as an official representative of IO for any other product, service, or matters of interest in your capacity as a spokesperson.

Additionally, some of you may be approved to engage with the media in an official capacity; however, that does not give you the license to seek out interviews on behalf of IO. Regardless of your position as a spokesperson, you are required to have a member of the Growth Team with you when speaking with the media in an official capacity. Finally, you are not under any obligation to speak to the media, so if someone approaches you and you do not wish to engage, you can always refer them to a member of the Growth Team, or kindly state that you are not able to comment on that but that they may reach out to [media@iohk.io](mailto:media@iohk.io).

### C. Third Party Sponsored Events

If you have been asked to attend an event on behalf of IO, you are expected to adhere to the Communications Code of Conduct (Section IV), while also sticking to the approved messaging that has been provided by the Growth Team. These opportunities are a chance for you to not only evolve as a thought leader, but a way to elevate IO's reputation and reach new audiences. As such, while you are speaking in an official capacity, anything that falls outside the agreed upon scope should be clearly stated as your own personal opinion.

As previously stated, in our digital world, nothing is ever really not connected back to your organization. As such, the Growth Team asks that you adhere to the Communications Code of Conduct and remember that anyone could be considered 'media' thanks to the 24-hour news cycle and the ability for videos and soundbites to go viral.

### D. Social Media

If you are an an employee or Service Provider who has been given written approval from their line manager and the Growth Team to act as a thought leader or advocate on a specific social media channel, then the Growth Team encourages you to tag any official IO handle in your profile and self-identify your role within the Company as part of your social media profile description.

More importantly, because you are identifying yourself as IO personnel, our goal is that the majority of the content you're promoting on that specific handle is related to IO, its products and services, and matters related to its research or interest as part of an organic marketing and/or thought leadership campaign.

In an official capacity on social media, the Growth Team recommends that you not only repost, retweet, share, etc. an official post from the respective IO handle to help promote any content, but that you are sharing additional context to help drive impressions and/or discussions. You are also highly encouraged to consider including additional materials, like approved creative assets, CTAs, approved messaging, etc. Remember, any additional content to provide context must go through the Approval Process discussed below. **However, under no circumstances are you to share confidential information or trade secrets publicly. If you ever have any doubts if something is confidential to a trade secret, please reach out to the Growth and Legal teams for clarification before publishing, speaking, or responding publicly.**

Remember, operating in an official capacity online does not mean you can speak with authority on all matters and/or products and services related to IO, just the ones for which you've received written approval.

### E. Becoming an Official Spokesperson

The Growth Team is constantly evaluating IO approved spokespeople, and we'll never know if you're interested unless you ask. If operating in an official capacity for IO is something that excites you, we encourage you to reach out to the Growth Team by emailing [comms@iohk.io](mailto:comms@iohk.io), or by using the Service Desk, and tell us why you want to be a spokesperson, what you're hoping to achieve (both professionally and personally), and what areas you think you're an expert in.

As a reminder, being an official spokesperson for the Company is a privilege, and the Growth Team reserves the right to change or alter the list at any time, based on the needs of the Company. If you are selected to become an official spokesperson, you are expected to strictly adhere to the guidelines outlined by the Growth Team, the terms included in this Policy, and represent the Company with integrity at all times. Failure to uphold these standards may result in your removal from the approved list. If your status as a spokesperson should change, the Growth Team will notify you in writing. All official spokespeople must notify [comms@iohk.io](mailto:comms@iohk.io) prior to engaging in any external communications or comments with the media to ensure strategic alignments on external commentary.

## III. SOCIAL MEDIA GUIDELINES & BEST PRACTICES

### A. Purpose

Social and online platforms provide many opportunities for IO's brand and our people, including building a positive reputation, influencing conversation and driving engagement and performance. Social and online activities also pose risks, which we all need to understand and manage.

With a new social media app being invented nearly every day, the examples and guidelines included below are not exhaustive and should be used as a framework for all applicable social media platforms. If you have any questions about a site not referenced in this document, please reach out to the Communications & Social Media Manager (see below under Useful Contacts). You may also reference the Social Media Confluence site for more information and a list of all official IO handles.

### B. Personal v. Professional Activity

IO employees may have personal or private online accounts, but if employees speak about IO, its products or services, Cardano (algorithms, technology, cryptocurrency, etc.) or blockchain technology related topics, such employees must adhere to the following guidelines and best practices:

As an IO employee or Service Contractor, if you do elect to post something that falls within the scope of IO's business operations or interest, you must clearly state that "the following opinions, views, or statements are my own and not a reflection of IO." Remember, operating in a personal capacity online does not mean you cannot be a brand ambassador for IO, we simply require that you leverage the creative assets, messaging, and approved content to ensure clear and consistent communications are being shared with respect to IO. **And again as previously stated, under no circumstances are you permitted to share confidential information or trade secrets.**

If you are operating in a personal capacity - meaning that you have not received written permission from your line manager and the Growth Team to represent IO on a specific social media platform:

1. We suggest that you do not include your IO affiliation in your social media profiles, with the exception of LinkedIn.

2. If employees choose to write anything related to the business of their employer on personal pages, posts, and comments, they will clearly identify their business affiliation. This can be noted in the copy of the social media post or the body of the long-form content; however, they must indicate that "the following opinions, views, or statements are their own and not a reflection of IO."

   a. The manner of disclosure can be flexible as long as it is a) clear and conspicuous, b) understandable by the average reader, and c) clearly visible within the relevant content. (Example disclosure methods could include: usernames that include the company name, or a statement in the post or comment itself, "I work for Input | Output (or IO) and this is my personal opinion," or use of an identifying hashtag, "#IAmIO").

3. Writing that does not cover work-related topics does not need to mention the employment relationship. For this Policy, 'work-related topics' includes anything about IO, its products and services, or the blockchain industry. If you are unsure if a topic relates to IO, please reach out to the Growth Team for clarification.

4. IO employees shall not say anywhere in their social media profiles (in particular, Linkedin) that they 'work for Cardano', as it is factually incorrect and misleading. Instead, you should indicate you work for IO, and may use the following description for the organization: "IO is a research and development company and one of the creators of Cardano. With a commitment to using peer-to-peer innovations, IO is also the creator behind [Atala Prism, Lace, Midnight, Hydra.]"

### C. Don't Forget Who "WE" Are!

You work for IO. You may be part of the team helping to build Cardano, but remember - you do not work for Cardano, which is a decentralized network and not an organization or entity. Always ensure any social posts are voiced accordingly. For example….

**CORRECT:** 'We [IO] have recently released an upgrade to the network to improve its capabilities.'

**INCORRECT:** 'We now have improved capabilities on the network.'

**CORRECT:** 'Cardano now has improved capabilities following the recent upgrade, delivered by IO.'

### D. Recommendations and Best Practices

- If you decide to post content related to IO's product, services, or ongoing initiatives, be sure to tag @InputOutputHK in your posts so the Growth Team has visibility on Twitter - or any of our other official social handles on different sites.
- Use $ADA #CardanoCommunity #Cardano when applicable.
- Clearly state that all your views are personal and not representative of the company or community, unless you are an authorized spokesperson.
- Ask yourself 'Is this adding value to the conversation?' before posting.
- Have fun and keep it lighthearted by all means, but keep it professional & have a positive attitude.
- Aim to follow the old adage 'If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything.'
- Keep it focused on the technology and what it can bring to the world.
- And remember, once something is on the internet, it lives forever.

### E. How to Combat Misinformation

- It's always important to prevent inaccuracies or misstatements spreading in the public domain. Please notify the Growth Team if you come across any misrepresentation or inaccurate statements about IO or its products or services. You may reach out to the Growth Team at [comms@iohk.io](mailto:comms@iohk.io) or use the Service Desk.
- If necessary, contact and work with the Legal Team at [legal@iohk.io](mailto:legal@iohk.io) as applicable and keep records or screenshot of any misstatements and subsequent responses.

### F. List of IO Social Media Accounts to Follow

For a complete list of social media accounts from IO, its subsidiaries, and ventures, please reach out to Anastassia Nilova until there's a page on the Intranet.

## IV. COMMUNICATIONS CODE OF CONDUCT

Diversity and inclusion make our ecosystem strong, but they can sometimes give rise to miscommunication and conflict. Therefore, you must adhere to the following Communications Code of Conduct when participating within the Cardano community or representing IO, both online and in person, to ensure all community members feel welcome and valued so as to foster collaboration and innovation.

The Communications Code of Conduct applies to all IO employees and Service Providers. This is not an exhaustive list of prohibited behavior, but rather a set of principles for maintaining a safe, helpful, friendly, and inclusive community.

### A. How to Communicate

1. Be considerate, friendly and patient.
2. Be respectful of other people, opinions, and viewpoints.
3. Be understanding and strive to resolve disagreements constructively.
4. Choose your words carefully and refrain from all forms of harassment, including but not limited to: violent threats or language directed against another person; discriminatory jokes and language; posting sexually explicit or violent material; posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifiable information; personal insults; derogatory, racist or sexist terms; unwelcome sexual attention.
5. Do not engage in talking negatively about competitive blockchains and distributed ledgers or organizations in the space—it is okay to compare and contrast differences but not to engage in negative discussions.
6. Do not offer to buy or sell ada or engage in price speculation.
7. Do not promote any giveaway or contest not endorsed by IO.
8. Do not encourage tax evasion, promote information leaks, or otherwise break the law.

### B. How to Speak About IO

1. Openly share and discuss IO's thought leadership and published marketing material; however, keep confidential any information about IO that has not yet been shared with the public. If you do not know for sure whether a piece of information has been made public or not - assume it hasn't!
2. Act and speak professionally in a manner that reflects positively on IO and the Cardano community.
3. Do not make inaccurate or deceptive statements about IO or its products and services.
4. Respect IO's Trademarks and Brand Usage Guidelines. *Coming soon!
5. Properly present your role at IO on LinkedIn or other social media, as well as at virtual and in-person events, i.e., do not present yourself as 'Cardano'.
6. Remember that you do not represent or speak for the Company, so always make it clear that what you are communicating is your personal opinion.

### C. Being Professional and Truthful

As business professionals we can lead conversations and grow our reputations by being professional, honest and respectful.

1. Always be truthful.
2. Ensure that information and claims provided to advocates, consumers, and social media sites are factual, honest, and accurate.
3. Never ask someone else to deceive readers for us.
4. Never ask advocates to write or say something they do not believe.
5. Never ask advocates to endorse a product or service they have not used personally or create any other form of false endorsement.
6. Insist that all opinions shared with the public are honest and authentic; all opinions and statements shall be made without manipulation or falsification.
7. Ensure that all individuals who are speaking for us are free to form their own opinions and share all feedback, including negative feedback.
8. Keep all confidential and proprietary information strictly confidential and away from any online channels.

### D. Avoid, Do Not Comment, and Do Not Disclose the Following

1. **Numbers:** Non-public financial, investment, or operational information. This includes strategies, forecasts, and anything with a dollar figure attached to it. If it's not already public information, it's not your job to make it so.

2. **Personal information:** Never share personal information about any members of IO, colleagues, partners, or customers.

3. **Regulatory and litigation matters:** This is a complex area and commenting on such matters should be avoided. In the context of this Policy, we encourage you not to join in on discussions related to new or proposed laws or regulations, lawsuits, investigations, policymakers' positions on the industry, etc. and if in doubt, please reach out to [legal@iohk.io](mailto:legal@iohk.io) or [comms@iohk.io](mailto:comms@iohk.io).

4. Do not share or link to any content or information owned by another company or person that could be considered confidential or commercially sensitive. Remember that IO has many NDAs in place and non-disclosure obligations, which need to be honored, and you have confidentiality obligations to the Company.

5. Be nice. A good rule of thumb to ask yourself is this: "Would I say this to someone's face?' or 'Would I shout this out in a crowded room?' If in any doubt, don't say it.

### E. Behavior That Will Not Be Tolerated

The following behaviors are considered to be unacceptable under these guidelines.

#### Protected Classes

U.S. federal law protects individuals from discrimination or harassment based on the following nine protected classes: sex, race, age, disability, color, creed, national origin, religion, or genetic information. All US and local country laws must be respected.

#### Violence and Threats of Violence

Violence and threats of violence are not acceptable - online or offline. This includes incitement of violence toward any individual, including but not limited to encouraging a person to commit self-harm. This also includes posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information.

#### Personal Attacks

Conflicts will inevitably arise, but frustration should never turn into a personal attack. It is not okay to insult, demean or belittle others. Attacking someone for their opinions, beliefs and ideas is not acceptable. It is important to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve, but such discussions must be conducted respectfully and professionally, remaining focused on the issue at hand.

#### Derogatory Language

Hurtful or harmful language related to: background, family status, gender, gender identity or expression, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, native language, age, ability, race and/or ethnicity, national origin, socioeconomic status, religion, geographic location, other attributes is not acceptable. This includes deliberately referring to someone by a gender that they do not identify with, and/or questioning the legitimacy of an individual's gender identity. If you're unsure if a word is derogatory, don't use it. This also includes repeated subtle and/or indirect discrimination; when asked to stop, stop the behavior in question.

---

## V. Notification & Approval Processes

### A. Notification Process

As identified in Section I above, any IO employee or Service Provider operating in a personal capacity is not operating as an official representative of IO because they have not received written approval from their line manager and the Growth Team, and they have not gone through the required media or communications training. These individuals are encouraged to follow the 'notification process.'

The notification process extends to both employee-initiatives or third-party driven opportunities for speaking or attending events or writing for a publication that may have some connection with IO, its products and services, or the blockchain industry. If an IO employee or Service Provider is interested in accepting an opportunity, then the Growth Team requires that you notify them prior to accepting the invitation, or committing to either contribute, speak, or attend.

While the Growth Team is not responsible for decisions made while individuals are operating within a personal capacity, we would like to remind all employees that any public-facing opportunity is not only a chance for you to elevate your own professional reputation, but IO's too. As such, when an IO employee notifies the Growth Team with proper lead time, we are able to potentially support you in the following ways:

- Provide messaging on IO, its products and services
- Vet the event, its speakers, attendees, etc. to ensure none pose a potential reputational risk
- Provide IO-branded visual aids
- Conduct general communications coaching to help you prepare for any speaking opportunity

Ultimately, the Growth Team isn't here to say no; however, when everything has the potential to be linked back to IO, it's in everyone's interest to notify the Growth Team - even if you don't need support from the areas identified above, you are still required to inform the team.

You can send an email to [comms@iohk.io](mailto:comms@iohk.io) or use the Service Desk.

### B. Approval Process

As identified in Section II, any IO employee or Service Provider operating in an official capacity is considered a IO spokesperson because they not only have received written approval from their line manager and the Growth Team, but have also gone through the required media or communications training. These individuals are required to follow the 'approval process' when attending an event, participating in a media interview, authoring a piece of content hosted by a third party, etc. within their duties as an approved IO spokesperson.

- The IO spokesperson should email [comms@iohk.io](mailto:comms@iohk.io), or use the new Service Desk, with the details of the opportunity and an overview of why they'd like to participate and how it brings value to IO not less than 5 business days prior to the opportunity, with an ideal lead time of 10 business days.

The Growth Team will work with you to ensure you have the following resources available:

- The latest approved messaging for IO products, services, or areas of interest
- Any updated brand graphics / product visual assets that you may use
- A chance to run through your presentation as part of general communications coaching, or specific media training if media will be in attendance
- Work with you on proofreading your content to ensure it conveys the topline messaging from IO's thought leadership pillars

Of course, any event, visual asset, written copy, social content, etc. that directly mentions IO, its products or services, its interests, or includes its trademarked assets, will need to go through explicit Growth and Legal approval prior to being published.

---

## VII. USEFUL CONTACTS AT IO

If you have any questions about the Policy, suggestions for improvement, or any pain points when it comes to communicating in a personal capacity or as an official spokesperson, feel free to share your comments with us by using the Service Desk. You may select the 'other' option and fill in the prompts accordingly. A member from one of the teams identified below will follow up to discuss in greater detail.

### A. Growth

The Growth function includes a number of shared services teams, including the Communications and Content functions within IO. Its primary role is to collaborate with product tribes to implement community, web3 driven marketing tactics to organically grow product followings.

1. Chief Growth Officer: Chris Ghent
2. SVP of Marketing & Communications: George Olexa
3. PR Consultant: Georgia Hanias
4. External Communications Manager: Jennifer Fedenisn
5. Social Media Strategist: Will Fricker

---

## VIII. COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS POLICY

### A. Monitoring

Words and actions have consequences. Violating this Policy will not be tolerated. To ensure compliance with this Policy, while mitigating any legal and/or reputational risk to IO, the Growth Team will periodically monitor traditional media and social media platforms, and will reach out to anyone with non-compliant statements or posts in an effort to bring the content into compliance with the Policy, and note the violation via an incident memo, etc.

Violations of this Policy may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination in accordance with the Company's applicable Handbooks [and its Global Code of Conduct], all of which outline a detailed disciplinary process. If you have any questions about this Policy and specifically related to the potential disciplinary consequences for violation of this Policy, contact your line manager or a Human Resource representative.

### B. Reporting Violations

If you are the subject of, or witness to, any violations of this Code of Conduct, contact the Growth Team at [comms@iohk.io](mailto:comms@iohk.io) and copy the Legal Team at [legal@iohk.io](mailto:legal@iohk.io) with the following information: (a) what part of this Policy was breached, (b) where and when did the violation occur, (c) who committed the breach (name or handle), and (d) any other relevant information as well as screenshot if possible.

Please note we are committed to protecting the safety and privacy of anyone who reports a violation.

### C. Incident Record-keeping

The Growth Team will maintain a record of all violations of this Policy committed by IO employees and Service Providers. The Legal Team and HR will be notified of all offenses. The Head of Risk and Compliance and SVP of Marketing, or its designees, will review the incident log periodically to assess potential IO communication risks and concerns.
